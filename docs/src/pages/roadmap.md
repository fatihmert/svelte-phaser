# Roadmap

I have no timelines for anything. I am slowly chipping away at making components and using them for my own little games. Pull Requests are welcome!

## Phaser Components

- BitmapText
- Blitter
- Bob
- Container
- Graphics
- Path Follower
- Sprite3D
- Video
- Zone
- Arc
- Curve
- Ellipse
- Grid
- IsoBox
- IsoTriangle
- Line
- Rectangle
- Star
- Triangle
- Rope
- Shader
- Lights
- Mesh
- Quad
- Tilemap / Tileset
- Camera

I have not used a lot of these Phaser game objects personally, so it will take me some time
to understand them and then figure out how they might work as Svelte components.
