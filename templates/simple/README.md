# svite

A template using svite for svelte-phaser. It's much faster than [rollup](../rollup), but slightly slower than [snowpack](../snowpack). However, HMR doesn't work quite right with snowpack and svelte-phaser, so svite is the recommended template to use.

## Available Scripts

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.

### npm run build

Builds the app for production to the `build/` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
